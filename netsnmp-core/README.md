# netsnmp-core

This library provides an FFI-interface wrapper to the netsnmp C API. This is not supposed to be used directly, rather you should use another library which wraps it, like netsnmp. 

## Notes

This library provides support for C net-snmp 5.5 or higher, as this has been considered the most stable SNMP v3 implementation.

To install it in your environment, just use your package manager:

```
# on OSX
> brew install net-snmp  

# Linux
> sudo yum install net-snmp
> sudo apt-get install net-snmp
```
